# Metafilter comments vs. Youtube comments

Pulls the most recent Metafilter comments and the most recent Youtube comments from the most popular videos and puts them side-by-side for hilarity.

## IMPORTANT, READ THIS:

This project is **obsolete** and has been replaced by a Ruby version found [here](https://github.com/bertrandom/mefi-vs-youtube-comments). It uses Symfony v1.0.8 which has been replaced by Symfony v1.1 which has been replaced by Symfony v1.2 which has been replaced by Symfony v1.3 which has been replaced by v1.4 which has [reached it's end-of-life support](http://symfony.com/legacy) and has been replaced by [Symfony v2.x](http://symfony.com/). In other words, even if you could get this working, you probably shouldn't because it would just be a [big security hole](http://symfony.com/blog/security-release-symfony-1-4-20-released) sitting on your server. This is only here for historical purposes.
